# Specification Quality Checklist

Feature: OrderBook Snapshot Persistence
Spec: `spec.md`
Date: 2025-10-19

## Content Quality

- [x] **User-focused scenarios**: All scenarios describe observable user outcomes, not implementation details
- [x] **No implementation leakage**: Spec avoids prescribing specific code structures, function names, or architectural patterns
- [x] **Business language**: Requirements use domain language (orderbook, snapshot, persistence) not technical jargon
- [x] **Clear priorities**: User stories are prioritized (P1, P2, P3) with justification

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] **Testable**: Each functional requirement can be verified through observable behavior
- [x] **Measurable**: Success criteria have concrete metrics (e.g., "60 snapshots per symbol per minute")
- [x] **Unambiguous**: Requirements have single interpretation without conditional language
- [x] **Complete**: All aspects of the feature are covered (happy path, error cases, edge cases)
- [x] **Traceable**: Each requirement maps to at least one user story acceptance scenario

## Functional Requirements (FR-001 to FR-010)

- [x] **FR-001**: WebSocket subscription on startup - Clear and testable
- [x] **FR-002**: 1-second snapshot interval - Measurable frequency specified
- [x] **FR-003**: MessagePack serialization - Specific format defined
- [x] **FR-004**: RocksDB key format - Exact schema provided
- [x] **FR-005**: Error handling - Non-crash requirement clear
- [x] **FR-006**: Success logging - Format and level specified
- [x] **FR-007**: Error logging - Level and detail requirements clear
- [x] **FR-008**: Analytics query compatibility - Integration requirement defined
- [x] **FR-009**: Existing functionality preservation - Regression prevention explicit
- [x] **FR-010**: Background task independence - Concurrency requirement clear

## Success Criteria (SC-001 to SC-005)

- [x] **SC-001**: Analytics tools work within 60 seconds - Time-bound, observable
- [x] **SC-002**: Snapshot logs at 1-second intervals - Frequency measurable
- [x] **SC-003**: 60 snapshots/min/symbol minimum - Concrete throughput metric
- [x] **SC-004**: Service uptime unaffected by errors - Reliability measurable
- [x] **SC-005**: Live orderbook latency <200ms - Performance threshold defined

## User Stories Validation

- [x] **Story 1 (P1)**: Has 4 independent acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then
- [x] **Story 2 (P2)**: Has 3 independent acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then
- [x] **Story 3 (P3)**: Has 3 independent acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then
- [x] **Priority justification**: Each story explains why its priority level is appropriate
- [x] **Independent testing**: Each story can be tested without dependencies on others

## Edge Cases & Assumptions

- [x] **Edge cases identified**: 5+ edge cases documented with answers
- [x] **Assumptions explicit**: Storage capacity, existing components, dependencies listed
- [x] **Out of scope clear**: Features NOT included are explicitly called out
- [x] **Dependencies documented**: RocksDB, WebSocket, MessagePack dependencies acknowledged

## Feature Readiness

- [x] **No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers**: All requirements are fully specified
- [x] **Acceptance criteria complete**: Every FR has corresponding acceptance scenario
- [x] **No implementation details**: Spec focuses on WHAT, not HOW
- [x] **Ready for planning**: Spec contains sufficient detail for design phase
