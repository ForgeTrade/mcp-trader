# Specification Quality Checklist: Fix SSE Schema Normalization Bugs

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**All items passed on first validation**:

1. **Content Quality**: ✅
   - Spec focuses on "what" and "why" without implementation details
   - Written for business stakeholders (describes user impact, not technical solutions)
   - No mention of specific Python classes, functions, or code changes
   - All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

2. **Requirement Completeness**: ✅
   - No clarification markers needed - all requirements are clear from test results
   - Each FR is testable (can verify if orderbook parsing works, if venue defaults correctly, etc.)
   - Success criteria are measurable with specific percentages (100% pass rate, 0% errors)
   - Success criteria avoid implementation details (no mention of Python, classes, etc.)
   - All three user stories have acceptance scenarios in Given/When/Then format
   - Edge cases identified (empty arrays, null fields, different data structures)
   - Out of Scope clearly defines what won't be addressed
   - Dependencies and Assumptions explicitly listed

3. **Feature Readiness**: ✅
   - Each FR has corresponding acceptance scenario in user stories
   - Three user stories cover all critical flows (orderbook access, klines access, venue defaulting)
   - Success criteria directly measure the outcomes (100% tool success, 0% errors, 100% pass rate)
   - No leakage of technical details (schema_adapter.py mentioned only in Dependencies, not in requirements)

**Specification is READY for `/speckit.plan` phase**.
