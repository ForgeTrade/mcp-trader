## Notes

### Outstanding Items

✅ **All clarifications resolved**

**FR-013 - Authentication decision**:
User selected Option B - Launch without authentication, add OAuth later. This enables faster testing and validation of the SSE/search/fetch functionality before adding authentication complexity.

### Spec Quality Assessment

✅ **Overall quality: High**

The specification successfully:
- Identifies the root cause (SSE transport requirement vs current HTTP JSON-RPC)
- Provides clear user stories with priorities
- Defines precise technical requirements for search/fetch tools
- Includes comprehensive edge cases
- Maintains backward compatibility explicitly
- Has measurable success criteria

**Recommendation**: Proceed to clarify OAuth requirement, then move to planning phase.
