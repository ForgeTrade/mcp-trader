# Requirements Validation Checklist

**Feature**: Fix Inverted Spread BPS Bug
**Spec File**: `specs/017-specify-scripts-bash/spec.md`
**Date**: 2025-10-20

## Specification Completeness

### Mandatory Sections
- [x] Feature name and branch specified
- [x] User Scenarios & Testing section present
- [x] Requirements section with Functional Requirements
- [x] Success Criteria with Measurable Outcomes
- [x] User stories prioritized (P1, P2, P3)
- [x] Each user story has "Why this priority" explanation
- [x] Each user story has "Independent Test" description
- [x] Acceptance scenarios use Given/When/Then format

### User Story Quality
- [x] User Story 1 is independently testable
- [x] User Story 1 priority justified (P1 - data integrity critical)
- [x] User Story 1 can be validated without other stories
- [x] Clear acceptance criteria defined (4 scenarios)
- [x] Edge cases documented (3 scenarios: locked markets, volatility, exchange bugs)

### Requirements Quality
- [x] Functional requirements are specific (FR-001 through FR-006)
- [x] Requirements are technology-agnostic where possible
- [x] Requirements are testable
- [x] No ambiguous "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" markers
- [x] Key entities documented (OrderBook, OrderBookMetrics)
- [x] Entity relationships described

### Success Criteria Quality
- [x] Success criteria are measurable (4 criteria with specific metrics)
- [x] SC-001: Zero tolerance for inversions (100% correct ordering)
- [x] SC-002: Zero tolerance for negative spreads (100% positive)
- [x] SC-003: Microprice bounds validated
- [x] SC-004: Quantifiable improvement metric (100% → 0% error rate)
- [x] Criteria align with user stories

### Technical Context
- [x] Current behavior documented with real production data
- [x] Expected behavior documented with corrected data
- [x] Root cause location identified (Binance provider, not gateway)
- [x] Dependencies listed (Binance provider, MCP gateway, production)
- [x] Assumptions documented (4 assumptions about bug location)

## Content Quality

### Clarity
- [x] Feature purpose clear from title
- [x] Problem statement unambiguous (inverted bid/ask with negative spread)
- [x] Technical terms defined (spread_bps, microprice, OrderBookMetrics)
- [x] User stories written in plain language
- [x] Code references specific and accurate

### Completeness
- [x] All mandatory sections complete
- [x] Edge cases considered
- [x] Error scenarios addressed (FR-005: reject invalid data)
- [x] Validation strategy included (independent testing)
- [x] Root cause analysis referenced (Feature 016 research)

### Consistency
- [x] Terminology consistent throughout (best_bid, best_ask, spread_bps)
- [x] References to other specs accurate (Feature 016 research.md)
- [x] File paths correct (schema_adapter.py lines 168-229)
- [x] Production data matches user bug report
- [x] Acceptance criteria align with functional requirements

## Validation Results

### Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Planning)
None identified ✅

### Warnings (Should Address)
None identified ✅

### Suggestions (Optional Improvements)
- Consider adding a user story for monitoring/alerting on bid/ask inversions
- Could add performance criteria (e.g., validation overhead < 1ms)
- Might document rollback strategy if fix introduces regressions

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

**Summary**: The specification is complete, clear, and testable. All mandatory sections are present with high-quality content. The single P1 user story is independently testable and directly addresses the critical data integrity bug. Success criteria are measurable with zero-tolerance thresholds appropriate for financial data. Technical context provides clear root cause analysis and expected fix location.

**Recommendation**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` phase to create implementation design.
