# Specification Quality Checklist: MCP Gateway System with Provider Orchestration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Iteration 1: Initial Validation
⚠️ **FAILED** - Implementation details present in requirements and success criteria

### Iteration 2: Refactoring Complete
✅ **PASS** - All validation items now meet quality standards

### Content Quality Review
✅ **PASS** - Specification maintains proper abstraction level:
- User stories written from AI client/system administrator perspective
- Focus on capabilities (tool discovery, routing, event handling) rather than specific technologies
- All mandatory sections completed with concrete details
- Requirements organized by functional area (Gateway Core, Provider Contract, Demo Providers, Events, Security)

### Requirement Completeness Review
✅ **PASS** - Requirements are technology-agnostic and testable:
- Removed specific technology names (gRPC, NATS, OpenTelemetry, Protocol Buffers, CloudEvents 1.0, JSON Schema Draft 2020-12)
- Replaced with generic concepts: "configuration file" instead of "providers.yaml", "message broker" instead of "NATS JetStream", "standard service interface" instead of "gRPC Provider service"
- Maintained testability: Each requirement has clear pass/fail criteria without specifying HOW it must be implemented
- All requirements use MUST/MAY/MUST NOT RFC 2119 keywords appropriately
- Examples and edge cases remain concrete and verifiable

### Key Entities Review
✅ **PASS** - Entities described without implementation details:
- Removed technology-specific references (gRPC, YAML, CloudEvents 1.0, NATS)
- Entities describe WHAT they represent, not HOW they're implemented
- Relationships between entities clearly defined
- Examples remain concrete (echo, sum, hello://greeting)

### Success Criteria Review
✅ **PASS** - All criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic:
- Removed "MCP Inspector" reference, replaced with "Standard MCP testing tools"
- Removed specific command strings, replaced with "standard development workflow commands"
- All metrics remain verifiable (time bounds, percentages, operational behaviors)
- Focus on user-observable outcomes rather than internal implementation

### Feature Readiness Review
✅ **PASS**:
- 25 functional requirements across 5 categories (Gateway Core: FR-001 to FR-012, Provider Contract: FR-013 to FR-016, Demo Providers: FR-017 to FR-021, Events: FR-022 to FR-024, Security: FR-025)
- 5 prioritized user stories (P1: Tool Discovery, P2: Resources & Multi-Provider, P3: Prompts, P4: Events)
- 10 comprehensive edge cases covering error scenarios and boundary conditions
- 11 measurable success criteria with specific performance targets
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - specification is complete and unambiguous

## Notes

- Specification successfully refactored to remove implementation details while preserving testability
- Source material (plan.md) was implementation-focused, but spec now properly abstracts to requirements level
- User stories focus on system capabilities from AI client and administrator perspectives
- Requirements describe interfaces and behaviors, not specific technologies
- Success criteria remain measurable with concrete metrics (3 seconds, 500ms, 100%, etc.)
- Edge cases comprehensively cover failure modes and boundary conditions
- All details provided in source plan successfully translated to technology-agnostic requirements
