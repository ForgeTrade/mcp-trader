# Tasks: Unified Market Data Report

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/018-market-data-report/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (‚úì), spec.md (‚úì), research.md (‚úì), data-model.md (‚úì), contracts/ (‚úì)

**Tests**: Tests are NOT explicitly requested in the specification. Unit tests and integration tests are included for quality assurance but are marked as optional enhancements.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Rust provider**: `providers/binance-rs/src/`
- **Python gateway**: `mcp-gateway/mcp_gateway/`
- **Tests**: `providers/binance-rs/tests/`
- **Contracts**: `providers/binance-rs/proto/`

**Checkpoint**: Liquidity analysis section now provides comprehensive guidance for order placement decisions

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Monitor Order Book Health and Data Quality (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Enhance the Data Health Status section and report header to prominently display data freshness, connectivity status, and health indicators

**Independent Test**: Request report and verify header shows generation timestamp and data age, "Data Health Status" section displays WebSocket connectivity, service status (Healthy/Degraded/Critical), and last update age

### Implementation for User Story 4

- [ ] T038 [US4] Enhance build_report_header() to display data freshness indicator with color-coded status (Fresh <1s, Recent <5s, Stale >5s) in providers/binance-rs/src/report/sections.rs

**Checkpoint**: All user stories (US1-US4) are now complete - the unified report provides comprehensive market intelligence with risk warnings, liquidity guidance, and data quality assurance

---

## Phase 7: Code Removal (Order Management Cleanup)

**Purpose**: Remove all order management methods and gRPC/MCP handlers as specified in requirements

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: This phase contains breaking changes - existing clients using order management will fail after this phase

- [ ] T044 [P] Remove create_order(), cancel_order(), query_order(), get_open_orders(), get_all_orders(), get_my_trades() methods from providers/binance-rs/src/binance/client.rs

- [ ] T052 Verify authentication infrastructure (auth.rs) is preserved and still compiles in providers/binance-rs/src/binance/auth.rs
- [ ] T053 Run cargo build to verify no compilation errors after method removal

**Checkpoint**: All order management code removed - system is now read-only market data analysis tool

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup (Phase 1) completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - MVP feature
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on User Story 1 (Phase 3) completion - enhances anomalies section
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on User Story 1 (Phase 3) completion - enhances liquidity section
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on User Story 1 (Phase 3) completion - enhances health section
- **Code Removal (Phase 7)**: Can start after User Story 1 (Phase 3) - independent of US2/US3/US4
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Core report generation - REQUIRED for MVP
  - Depends on: Foundational phase only
  - Blocks: US2, US3, US4 (they enhance sections created in US1)

- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Enhanced anomaly detection display
  - Depends on: US1 (enhances build_anomalies_section created in US1)
  - Blocks: None (independent enhancement)

- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Enhanced liquidity analysis display
  - Depends on: US1 (enhances build_liquidity_analysis_section created in US1)
  - Blocks: None (independent enhancement)

- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Enhanced data health monitoring
  - Depends on: US1 (enhances header and data health section created in US1)
  - Blocks: None (independent enhancement)

### Within Each User Story

**User Story 1 (Core Report)**:
1. Section builders (T012-T019) can run in parallel [P]
2. ReportGenerator constructor (T020) depends on section builders
3. Data fetching logic (T021) can be done in parallel with section builders
4. Assembly logic (T022-T023) depends on both section builders and data fetching
5. gRPC/MCP integration (T024-T027) depends on ReportGenerator being complete

**User Story 2-4 (Enhancements)**:
- All tasks within US2, US3, US4 modify different sections
- US2 (T028-T032), US3 (T033-T037), US4 (T038-T043) can run in parallel

**Code Removal (Phase 7)**:
- All removal tasks (T044-T050) can run in parallel [P]
- Verification tasks (T051-T053) must run sequentially after removals

**Polish (Phase 8)**:
- Most tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (different test files, docs)
- Performance profiling (T065-T066) should run after all features complete
- Validation (T071) should be last

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup Phase**: T002, T003 can run in parallel (different directories)
- **Foundational Phase**: T005, T006, T007 can run in parallel (struct definitions), T009 can run in parallel with T008
- **User Story 1**: T012-T019 (all section builders) can run in parallel, T024-T027 (integrations) can run after core is done
- **User Stories 2, 3, 4**: Can all run in parallel if team capacity allows (different sections)
- **Code Removal**: T044-T050 can all run in parallel (different files/methods)
- **Polish**: T054-T061 (tests), T062-T064 (docs), T068-T070 (linting) can run in parallel

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T004)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T005-T011) - **CRITICAL GATE**
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T012-T027)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**:
   - Test: `generate_report("BTCUSDT", default)`
   - Verify: Markdown output with all 7+ sections
   - Performance: Check <5s cold, <3s cached
5. **OPTIONAL**: Deploy MVP for early feedback

**MVP Scope**: At this point you have a working unified market data report generator. Traders can request comprehensive reports via gRPC or MCP. This is production-ready.

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Foundation** (Phases 1-2): Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready (T001-T011)
2. **MVP** (Phase 3): Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (T012-T027)
3. **Enhanced Anomalies** (Phase 4): Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test anomaly section ‚Üí Deploy (T028-T032)
4. **Enhanced Liquidity** (Phase 5): Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test liquidity section ‚Üí Deploy (T033-T037)
5. **Enhanced Health** (Phase 6): Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test health monitoring ‚Üí Deploy (T038-T043)
6. **Code Cleanup** (Phase 7): Remove order management ‚Üí Test no breakage in reports ‚Üí Deploy (T044-T053)
7. **Production Ready** (Phase 8): Polish, tests, docs ‚Üí Final validation ‚Üí Production release (T054-T071)

Each story adds value without breaking previous stories.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers after Foundation (Phase 2) is complete:

**Sprint 1: MVP (Foundation + US1)**
- Entire team: Complete Setup (Phase 1) and Foundational (Phase 2) together
- Entire team: Complete User Story 1 (Phase 3) together - critical path

**Sprint 2: Enhancements (US2, US3, US4)**
- Developer A: User Story 2 (anomaly enhancements)
- Developer B: User Story 3 (liquidity enhancements)
- Developer C: User Story 4 (health monitoring enhancements)
- Stories complete independently in parallel

**Sprint 3: Cleanup & Polish**
- Developer A: Code Removal (Phase 7)
- Developer B + C: Tests and Documentation (Phase 8)

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies within phase
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- **Breaking Change Warning**: Phase 7 removes all order management - communicate to stakeholders before deployment
- Authentication infrastructure (auth.rs) is explicitly preserved per FR-012
- Feature flag `orderbook_analytics` must be handled gracefully in sections (US1 T017, T018)
- Cache TTL is 60 seconds per research.md decision
- Performance targets: <5s cold, <3s cached (validate in T065-T066)
