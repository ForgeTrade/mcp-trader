# Tasks: MCP Gateway System with Provider Orchestration

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-specify-scripts-bash/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are NOT explicitly requested in the specification. This tasks list focuses on implementation and manual testing with MCP Inspector.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Gateway**: `mcp-gateway/mcp_gateway/`
- **Go Provider**: `providers/hello-go/`
- **Rust Provider**: `providers/hello-rs/`
- **Shared**: `pkg/proto/`, `pkg/schemas/`

---

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T011 Generate Python gRPC code from pkg/proto/provider.proto to mcp-gateway/mcp_gateway/generated/
- [ ] T012 [P] Generate Go gRPC code from pkg/proto/provider.proto to providers/hello-go/internal/pb/

- [ ] T015 [P] Create mcp_gateway/providers_registry.py module with ProviderRegistry class for provider management
- [ ] T016 [P] Create mcp_gateway/adapters/grpc_client.py module with ProviderGRPCClient class (connection pooling: 15 channels per provider)
- [ ] T017 Create mcp_gateway/adapters/__init__.py empty file
- [ ] T018 Create mcp_gateway/__init__.py empty file

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Prompt Template Discovery (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Enable AI clients to discover and use prompt templates from providers

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Multi-Provider Aggregation (Priority: P2)

**Checkpoint**: Language-agnostic provider contract validated - both Go and Rust providers work identically

---

## Phase 7: User Story 5 - Event Stream Consumption (Priority: P4) [OPTIONAL]

**Goal**: Enable providers to publish events to NATS and gateway to consume them

**Independent Test**: Publish CloudEvent from hello-go, verify gateway receives it within 2 seconds, restart gateway and verify event replay

### Implementation for User Story 5 (Optional)

#### Infrastructure

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion (especially T002 proto copy, T011-T013 codegen) - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational completion - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational completion - Builds on US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational completion - Builds on US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on Foundational completion - Can run in parallel with US2/US3
- **User Story 5 (Phase 7)**: Depends on Foundational completion - Fully independent, optional
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - **MVP MILESTONE**
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Adds resource support to working tool system
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational - Adds prompt support to working tool system
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Validates multi-provider architecture
- **User Story 5 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational - Optional feature, fully independent

### Within Each User Story

- Provider implementation before gateway handlers
- Capability registration before RPC implementations
- Schema loading before validation logic
- Connection setup before request routing
- Error handling after happy path implementation

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**:
- T003-T007 can all run in parallel (different projects)
- T008-T010 can run in parallel (infrastructure files)

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**:
- T012-T013 can run in parallel (Go/Rust codegen)
- T014-T016 can run in parallel (different Python modules)

**Phase 3 (User Story 1)**:
- T019-T020 can run in parallel (different Go tool files)
- T021-T024 are sequential (depends on T019-T020)
- T025-T028 can run in parallel (different gateway modules)

**Between User Stories**:
- Once Foundational is complete, US2, US3, US4, US5 can ALL start in parallel if team capacity allows
- Different team members can own different stories

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch Provider work and Gateway work in parallel:

# Provider Thread:
Task T019: "Create echo.go tool"
Task T020: "Create sum.go tool"  # parallel with T019
Then T021-T024 sequentially

# Gateway Thread:
Task T025: "Implement load_providers()"
Task T026: "Implement list_capabilities()"  # parallel with T025
Task T027: "Implement discover_capabilities()"
Task T028: "Implement validate()"  # parallel with T025-T027
Then T029-T037 sequentially
```

---

## Parallel Example: Multi-Story Development

```bash
# After Foundational Phase completes, launch multiple stories:

# Developer A: User Story 1 (T019-T037)
# Developer B: User Story 4 (T052-T062) - Rust provider
# Developer C: User Story 2 (T038-T044) - Resources
# Developer D: User Story 3 (T045-T051) - Prompts

# All stories integrate independently without conflicts
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup ‚Üí Directory structure, dependencies, protobuf
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational ‚Üí Codegen, base modules (CRITICAL!)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 ‚Üí hello-go provider + gateway tool proxying
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test with MCP Inspector
   - Verify tools appear: hello-go.echo.v1, hello-go.sum.v1
   - Invoke echo with {"message": "test"}
   - Invoke sum with {"numbers": [1,2,3]}
   - Verify <500ms latency, <3s discovery time
5. **MVP COMPLETE** - Deployable system with core value

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Foundation** (Phases 1-2): ~18 tasks ‚Üí Protobuf contract + base infrastructure ready
2. **MVP** (Phase 3): +19 tasks ‚Üí Tool discovery and invocation working ‚Üí **DEMO/DEPLOY**
3. **Resources** (Phase 4): +7 tasks ‚Üí Resource access added ‚Üí **DEMO/DEPLOY**
4. **Prompts** (Phase 5): +7 tasks ‚Üí Prompt templates added ‚Üí **DEMO/DEPLOY**
5. **Multi-Provider** (Phase 6): +11 tasks ‚Üí Rust provider validates architecture ‚Üí **DEMO/DEPLOY**
6. **Events** (Phase 7): +11 tasks (optional) ‚Üí Event streaming added ‚Üí **DEMO/DEPLOY**
7. **Polish** (Phase 8): +12 tasks ‚Üí Production-ready ‚Üí **PRODUCTION DEPLOY**

Each phase adds incremental value without breaking previous functionality.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 3-4 developers after Foundational phase completes:

**Week 1** (Foundation):
- All developers: Complete Setup + Foundational together (critical path)

**Week 2** (MVP):
- All developers: Focus on User Story 1 completion and validation
- Milestone: MVP demo with MCP Inspector

**Week 3** (Expansion):
- Developer A: User Story 2 (Resources)
- Developer B: User Story 4 (Rust provider)
- Developer C: User Story 3 (Prompts)
- Developer D: User Story 5 (Events) or Polish tasks

**Week 4** (Integration & Polish):
- All developers: Integration testing, polish, documentation
- Milestone: Production deployment

---

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies - safe to parallelize
- **[Story] label** maps task to specific user story for traceability
- **Each user story independently completable** - can stop after any phase for demo
- **No tests explicitly requested** - validation via MCP Inspector per quickstart.md
- **Constitution compliance**: Simple procedural code, library-first approach, justified abstractions only
- **Commit strategy**: Commit after completing each logical phase or task group
- **Checkpoints**: Stop at any checkpoint to validate story works independently before proceeding
- **MVP = Phase 3 complete**: Delivers core value (tool discovery and invocation from one provider)
- **Avoid**: Cross-story dependencies, same-file conflicts, speculative features not in spec

---

## Task Count Summary

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: 10 tasks
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: 8 tasks
- **Phase 3 (US1 - MVP)**: 19 tasks
- **Phase 4 (US2 - Resources)**: 7 tasks
- **Phase 5 (US3 - Prompts)**: 7 tasks
- **Phase 6 (US4 - Multi-Provider)**: 11 tasks
- **Phase 7 (US5 - Events, Optional)**: 11 tasks
- **Phase 8 (Polish)**: 12 tasks

**Total**: 85 tasks
**MVP (Phases 1-3)**: 37 tasks
**Parallel opportunities**: ~30 tasks marked [P]
**Independent stories**: 5 user stories can proceed in parallel after Foundational
