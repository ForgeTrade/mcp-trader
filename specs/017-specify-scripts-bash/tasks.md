# Tasks: Fix Inverted Spread BPS Bug

**Input**: Design documents from `/home/limerc/repos/ForgeTrade/mcp-trader/specs/017-specify-scripts-bash/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md
**Branch**: `017-specify-scripts-bash`

**Tests**: Validation using existing `test_sse_client.py` (no new tests required)

**Organization**: Tasks organized by user story to enable independent bugfix implementation and testing.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Binance Provider: `/home/limerc/repos/ForgeTrade/mcp-trader/providers/binance-rs/`
- Test script: `/home/limerc/repos/ForgeTrade/mcp-trader/test_sse_client.py`

---

## Phase 1: Setup & Verification

**Purpose**: Verify current buggy behavior and prepare for fix

- [ ] T001 [P] Verify current bug by reading providers/binance-rs/src/orderbook/metrics.rs lines 88-89
- [ ] T002 [P] Confirm test script exists at /home/limerc/repos/ForgeTrade/mcp-trader/test_sse_client.py
- [ ] T003 Document current buggy behavior: best_bid=111,323.58 (higher), best_ask=111,294.22 (lower), spread_bps=-2.6374

**Checkpoint**: Bug location confirmed, test infrastructure ready

---

## Phase 2: User Story 1 - Correct Best Bid/Ask Ordering (Priority: P1) ðŸŽ¯ MVP

**Goal**: Fix the swapped best_bid and best_ask assignments in OrderBookMetrics struct initialization so that best_bid < best_ask and spread_bps > 0.

**Independent Test**: Call `market.get_orderbook_l1` for BTCUSDT and verify that best_bid < best_ask and spread_bps > 0 in all responses.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T004 [US1] Swap best_bid assignment in providers/binance-rs/src/orderbook/metrics.rs line 88 from best_bid.to_string() to best_ask.to_string()
- [ ] T005 [US1] Swap best_ask assignment in providers/binance-rs/src/orderbook/metrics.rs line 89 from best_ask.to_string() to best_bid.to_string()
- [ ] T006 [US1] Add comment explaining the swap in providers/binance-rs/src/orderbook/metrics.rs lines 88-89
- [ ] T007 [US1] Build Binance provider with: cd providers/binance-rs && cargo build --release
- [ ] T008 [US1] Run Binance provider unit tests with: cd providers/binance-rs && cargo test --release
- [ ] T009 [US1] Restart Binance provider process on port 50053 with new binary
- [ ] T010 [US1] Test BTCUSDT orderbook L1 with test_sse_client.py and verify best_bid < best_ask
- [ ] T011 [US1] Test BTCUSDT orderbook L1 and verify spread_bps > 0 (should be +2.6374 instead of -2.6374)
- [ ] T012 [US1] Test BTCUSDT orderbook L1 and verify microprice is between bid and ask: best_bid <= microprice <= best_ask
- [ ] T013 [P] [US1] Test ETHUSDT orderbook L1 with test_sse_client.py for regression testing
- [ ] T014 [P] [US1] Test BNBUSDT orderbook L1 with test_sse_client.py for regression testing
- [ ] T015 [US1] Verify 10 consecutive BTCUSDT orderbook L1 requests all have correct bid/ask ordering

**Checkpoint**: Orderbook L1 tool returns correct bid < ask ordering with positive spread_bps for all trading pairs

---

## Phase 3: Final Validation & Documentation

**Purpose**: Comprehensive testing and documentation of bugfix

- [ ] T016 Verify success criteria SC-001: 100% of orderbook L1 responses have best_bid < best_ask (zero tolerance)
- [ ] T017 Verify success criteria SC-002: 100% of orderbook L1 responses have spread_bps > 0 for non-locked markets
- [ ] T018 Verify success criteria SC-003: Microprice falls between best_bid and best_ask in all responses
- [ ] T019 [P] Document fix in specs/017-specify-scripts-bash/research.md "Verification" section with test results
- [ ] T020 [P] Update specs/017-specify-scripts-bash/checklists/requirements.md with implementation status
- [ ] T021 Check Binance provider logs at /tmp/binance-provider.log for any errors or warnings
- [ ] T022 Verify no negative spread_bps values in provider logs

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **User Story 1 (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - This is the core bugfix (P1)
- **Final Validation (Phase 3)**: Depends on User Story 1 completion

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Independent - single file modification, can start after setup

### Within Each Phase

**Setup Phase**:
- T001, T002 can run in parallel (independent reads)
- T003 depends on T001 completion

**User Story 1 Phase**:
- T004, T005, T006 must run sequentially (same file, same lines)
- T007 depends on T004-T006 (must apply code changes before building)
- T008 depends on T007 (must build before testing)
- T009 depends on T007 (must build before restarting)
- T010, T011, T012 depend on T009 (must restart provider before integration testing)
- T013, T014 can run in parallel with each other after T012 (independent symbols)
- T015 depends on T010-T014 (final verification after all tests pass)

**Final Validation Phase**:
- T016, T017, T018 must run sequentially (build on each other)
- T019, T020 can run in parallel (independent documentation)
- T021, T022 depend on all previous tasks (log analysis)

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 Setup**: T001 and T002 can run in parallel
- **Phase 2 User Story 1**: T013 and T014 can run in parallel (different trading pairs)
- **Phase 3 Final Validation**: T019 and T020 can run in parallel (different files)

---

## Parallel Example: Phase 2 (User Story 1) Testing

```bash
# After T012 completes, launch T013 and T014 in parallel:
Task: "Test ETHUSDT orderbook L1 for regression"
Task: "Test BNBUSDT orderbook L1 for regression"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (verify bug location)
2. Complete Phase 2: User Story 1 (apply the 2-line fix)
3. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test orderbook_l1 with BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT, BNBUSDT
4. Target: 100% correct bid/ask ordering, 100% positive spread_bps

### Single Developer Strategy (Recommended for bugfix)

1. Setup phase (T001-T003) - 2 minutes
2. Apply fix (T004-T006) - 2 minutes
3. Build and test (T007-T009) - 5 minutes
4. Integration testing (T010-T015) - 5 minutes
5. Final validation (T016-T022) - 5 minutes

**Total estimated time**: ~20 minutes

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup â†’ Bug location verified
2. Apply Fix â†’ Code changed (2 lines swapped)
3. Build â†’ Binary updated
4. Restart â†’ New code running
5. Test â†’ Verify fix works
6. Each step adds value and can be validated independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files or independent testing, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- This is a **single user story bugfix** (only US1)
- Use existing test_sse_client.py for validation - no new tests needed
- **Critical**: Lines 88-89 in metrics.rs must be swapped together (single atomic change)
- Success measured by: bid < ask AND spread_bps > 0 for ALL orderbook L1 requests
- All changes isolated to 1 file: `providers/binance-rs/src/orderbook/metrics.rs`
- Fix is **2 lines**: swap two assignments in struct initialization
- Risk: Very low (localized change, easy rollback)
- Impact: Critical (fixes 100% of inverted orderbook data)

## Expected Outcomes

**Before Fix**:
- best_bid: 111,323.58 (HIGHER - wrong!)
- best_ask: 111,294.22 (LOWER - wrong!)
- spread_bps: -2.6374 (NEGATIVE - impossible!)

**After Fix**:
- best_bid: 111,294.22 (LOWER - correct!)
- best_ask: 111,323.58 (HIGHER - correct!)
- spread_bps: +2.6374 (POSITIVE - correct!)
- microprice: between 111,294.22 and 111,323.58 (correct!)
