# Feature Specification: GitHub CI/CD Pipeline with Container Registry

**Feature Branch**: `019-github-cicd-pipeline`
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "давай сделаем github cicd чтобы билдилось в ci, пушилось в github регистри а потом тянулось на серваке и разворачивалось в docker-compose. Чтобы билд проходил не на серваке, там просто тянулся образ."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Automated Build and Registry Push (Priority: P1)

When developers push code changes to the repository, the system automatically builds container images in the CI environment and pushes them to GitHub Container Registry, eliminating manual build steps and ensuring consistent builds.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation of the CI/CD pipeline. Without automated builds, there's no automation to speak of. This delivers immediate value by removing manual build steps and ensuring all builds are consistent and reproducible.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by pushing a commit to the repository and verifying that: (1) CI job triggers automatically, (2) container images are built successfully, (3) images appear in GitHub Container Registry with correct tags. Delivers value by automating the build process even before deployment automation exists.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer pushes code to the main branch, **When** the push is detected by GitHub, **Then** a CI workflow automatically triggers and builds all container images
2. **Given** container images are built successfully, **When** the build completes, **Then** images are tagged with commit SHA and pushed to GitHub Container Registry
3. **Given** a build fails due to compilation errors, **When** the CI job completes, **Then** the developer receives a failure notification with error details and the registry is not updated

---

### User Story 2 - Server Deployment via Image Pull (Priority: P2)

When new container images are available in the registry, the server can pull these pre-built images and deploy them using docker-compose, without needing to build anything locally on the server.

**Why this priority**: This completes the deployment automation and is the direct consumer of the P1 story. It delivers value by eliminating server-side builds, reducing server resource requirements, and speeding up deployments significantly.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by: (1) manually triggering image pull from registry on server, (2) running docker-compose up with registry images, (3) verifying services start correctly. Delivers value by enabling fast, lightweight deployments even if automatic triggering isn't implemented yet.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new image exists in GitHub Container Registry, **When** deployment is triggered on the server, **Then** the server pulls the pre-built image without attempting local builds
2. **Given** the image is pulled successfully, **When** docker-compose up is executed, **Then** services start using the pulled images
3. **Given** an image pull fails due to network issues, **When** the pull operation times out, **Then** the system retries the pull operation and logs the failure for investigation

---

### User Story 3 - Automated Deployment Trigger (Priority: P3)

When new images are successfully pushed to the registry, the server is automatically notified and triggers a deployment, completing the fully automated CI/CD pipeline from code push to production deployment.

**Why this priority**: This is the final automation step that removes manual intervention. While valuable, the pipeline is functional without it (P1 + P2 already provide significant value). This story optimizes the workflow for zero-touch deployments.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by pushing code and verifying the entire chain: CI builds → registry push → server notification → automatic deployment → services running new version. Delivers value by achieving complete automation of the release process.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new image is pushed to the registry, **When** the push completes successfully, **Then** the server receives a notification to trigger deployment
2. **Given** the server receives a deployment trigger, **When** the notification is processed, **Then** the server pulls the latest images and restarts services via docker-compose
3. **Given** multiple rapid commits are pushed, **When** builds complete in quick succession, **Then** only the latest successful build triggers deployment, avoiding redundant deployments

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the GitHub Container Registry is temporarily unavailable during image push?
- How does the system handle partial failures where some images build successfully but others fail?
- What happens if the server is offline when a deployment notification arrives?
- How does the system handle rollback scenarios when a newly deployed version has issues?
- What happens when network connectivity between server and registry is interrupted during image pull?
- How are concurrent deployments prevented when multiple commits are pushed rapidly?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST build container images automatically when code changes are pushed to designated branches
- **FR-002**: System MUST build images in the CI environment, not on the deployment server
- **FR-003**: System MUST push successfully built images to GitHub Container Registry
- **FR-004**: System MUST tag images with both version identifiers (commit SHA, semantic version tags) and environment tags (latest, stable)
- **FR-005**: Server deployment process MUST pull pre-built images from GitHub Container Registry
- **FR-006**: Server MUST NOT perform local image builds during deployment
- **FR-007**: System MUST use docker-compose to orchestrate container deployment on the server
- **FR-008**: System MUST authenticate with GitHub Container Registry using secure credentials
- **FR-009**: CI workflow MUST fail and prevent registry push if any build step fails
- **FR-010**: System MUST support deploying multiple services/containers as defined in docker-compose configuration
- **FR-011**: Deployment process MUST preserve configuration and data volumes during updates
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide deployment status feedback (success/failure) in both GitHub Actions workflow status (visible in GitHub UI) and server logs for redundancy and different access patterns

### Key Entities

- **Container Image**: Pre-built application artifact stored in GitHub Container Registry, identified by repository name and tags (commit SHA, version, environment)
- **CI Workflow**: Automated pipeline configuration that defines build steps, triggers, and registry push operations
- **Deployment Configuration**: docker-compose file defining services, image sources, volumes, networks, and environment variables for server deployment

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Developers can push code changes and have production-ready container images available in the registry within 5 minutes for standard builds
- **SC-002**: Server deployments complete within 2 minutes from deployment trigger to all services running (excluding first-time image pulls)
- **SC-003**: Zero successful deployments occur with locally-built images (100% of deployments use registry images)
- **SC-004**: Build failures are detected and reported before any failed images reach the registry (0% failed builds pushed)
- **SC-005**: Deployment process maintains zero data loss during service updates (100% preservation of volumes and configurations)
- **SC-006**: Server resource utilization during deployments is reduced by at least 70% compared to local builds (no CPU/memory consumed for compilation)

## Assumptions

- The project already has working Dockerfiles for all services that need to be containerized
- The deployment server has docker and docker-compose installed and configured
- GitHub Actions is the assumed CI platform (standard for GitHub-hosted projects)
- Network connectivity between server and GitHub Container Registry is reliable (standard datacenter/cloud networking)
- The server has sufficient disk space to store pulled images and container volumes
- GitHub Container Registry permissions can be configured to allow CI push and server pull access
- The project uses git branches to manage different environments (main, staging, etc.)

## Out of Scope

- Multi-cloud registry support (only GitHub Container Registry)
- Advanced deployment strategies (blue-green, canary, rolling updates beyond docker-compose capabilities)
- Image vulnerability scanning and security audits (can be added later)
- Automated rollback mechanisms (manual rollback procedures assumed)
- Multi-server orchestration or cluster deployments
- Database migration automation (assumed to be handled separately)
- Monitoring and alerting integration (deployment notifications only)
