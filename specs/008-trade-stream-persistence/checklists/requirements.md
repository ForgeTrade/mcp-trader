# Specification Quality Checklist: Trade Stream Persistence

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ Spec focuses on *what* the system does (collect trades, persist data, serve analytics) without mentioning Rust, specific libraries, or code structure
- ✅ User stories emphasize business value: analytics tools work, operators can monitor, service stays stable
- ✅ Language is accessible: "trade data collection", "volume profile analytics", "storage growth" - no technical jargon
- ✅ All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ No clarification markers in spec
- ✅ Each FR has clear pass/fail criteria: "System MUST subscribe", "System MUST collect and persist", "System MUST batch trades every 1 second"
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable: "60-600 trades/min", "10-15 MB/day", "<2% CPU", "<3 seconds query time"
- ✅ Success criteria avoid implementation: "Analytics tools return valid results" (not "RocksDB query performance"), "Storage growth predictable" (not "MessagePack compression ratio")
- ✅ Acceptance scenarios provided for all 3 user stories (total 9 scenarios)
- ✅ 5 edge cases identified: connection drops, high velocity, startup queries, retention cleanup, storage limits
- ✅ Out of Scope section clearly defines exclusions: trade aggregation, multi-exchange, real-time streaming, backfilling
- ✅ Dependencies section lists Feature 007, Binance API, RocksDB, tokio-tungstenite
- ✅ Assumptions section documents 7 reasonable defaults

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ Each of 10 FRs maps to acceptance scenarios: FR-001 (WebSocket subscription) → US1/AS1, FR-008 (logging) → US2/AS1
- ✅ Primary flows covered: analytics tool usage (US1), operator monitoring (US2), error resilience (US3)
- ✅ Success criteria align with user stories: SC-001 (tools work) ← US1, SC-006 (99.9% uptime) ← US3
- ✅ Spec maintains abstraction: mentions "persistent storage" not "RocksDB WriteBatch", "WebSocket streams" not "tokio-tungstenite with native-tls"

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ **PASSED** - All quality criteria met

**Checklist Score**: 12/12 items passed (100%)

**Readiness**: Ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify`

**Key Strengths**:
1. Clear value proposition: Makes two analytics tools functional that currently fail
2. Well-defined MVP (User Story 1 P1) that can be independently tested and deployed
3. Comprehensive edge cases covering real-world scenarios (connection drops, high volatility, disk full)
4. Technology-agnostic success criteria that focus on user outcomes
5. Explicit dependencies on Feature 007 infrastructure (reuses patterns)

**Recommendations**:
- None - specification is complete and ready for planning phase
- Consider documenting trade data schema in planning phase for storage format design
- Plan should address WebSocket reconnection strategy in detail (mentioned in edge cases but not fully specified)
