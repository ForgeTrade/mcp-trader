# Specification Quality Checklist: Binance Provider Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Content Quality**: ✅ PASS
- Specification focuses on WHAT users need (market data access, account management, order execution) without prescribing HOW to implement it
- Written in business-friendly language with clear user stories
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are completed

**Requirement Completeness**: ✅ PASS
- All 35 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- Success criteria include specific metrics (2-second response times, 3-second latency, 200ms updates)
- Each user story has clearly defined acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format
- 7 edge cases identified covering rate limits, connectivity, credentials, and system failures
- Scope is bounded to Binance provider integration (no other exchanges)
- 8 assumptions documented including credential management, network latency, and feature flags

**Feature Readiness**: ✅ PASS
- Each of 4 user stories is independently testable with clear priority levels (P1-P4)
- User scenarios progress from basic market data (P1) to advanced order book analysis (P4)
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (e.g., "response times under 2 seconds" vs "gRPC latency < 2s")
- No implementation details in spec (Rust, gRPC, protobuf mentioned only in context of existing provider structure, not as requirements)

**Overall Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

All 16 checklist items passed. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for the next phase (`/speckit.plan`).
