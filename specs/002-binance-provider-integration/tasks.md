# Tasks: Binance Provider Integration

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-binance-provider-integration/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Tests are NOT explicitly requested in the specification. Focus on implementation tasks.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Provider**: `providers/binance-rs/` (new Rust provider)
- **Gateway**: `mcp-gateway/` (existing Python gateway)
- **Shared**: `pkg/proto/`, `pkg/schemas/`
- **Root**: `Makefile`, `README.md`

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Story Completion Order

```
Phase 1 (Setup) ‚Üí Phase 2 (Foundational) ‚Üí Phase 3-6 can run in parallel ‚Üí Phase 7-8 (require US1-3) ‚Üí Phase 9-10
                                           ‚Üì
                                    User Story 1 (P1) üéØ MVP
                                    User Story 2 (P2) (independent)
                                    User Story 3 (P3) (independent)
                                    User Story 4 (P4) (independent)
```

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1** (Market Data): No dependencies, can implement immediately after Phase 2
- **User Story 2** (Account Info): Independent of US1, requires API credentials
- **User Story 3** (Order Management): Independent of US1-2, requires API credentials
- **User Story 4** (OrderBook): Independent of US1-3, optional feature flag
- **Prompts** (Phase 7): Depend on US1 (market data) and US2 (account data)
- **Resources** (Phase 8): Depend on US1-3 for data aggregation

### Blocking Relationships

- Phase 2 (T009-T018) MUST complete before any user story
- Prompts (T094-T103) require US1 and US2 tools implemented
- Resources (T104-T109) require respective US tools implemented
- Integration tests (T110-T125) require all user stories implemented

**Polish** (Phase 10):
- T126-T131 (all parallel - documentation)
- T134-T137 (all parallel - configuration)
- T139-T142 (all parallel - logging)

### Maximum Parallelization Example

After Phase 2 complete, you could run:

- 1 developer on User Story 2 (T039-T054)
- 1 developer on User Story 3 (T055-T075)
