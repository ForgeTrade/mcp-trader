# Specification Quality Checklist: Unified Multi-Exchange Gateway

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Content Quality**: ✅ PASSED
- Spec avoids implementation specifics while describing architecture patterns (gRPC Provider API, JSON Schema normalization, routing layers)
- All technical terms are presented as requirements, not prescriptive solutions
- Focuses on business value: multi-exchange scaling, AI client usability, operational reliability
- All mandatory sections are complete and well-structured

**Requirement Completeness**: ✅ PASSED
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are well-defined with concrete criteria
- Requirements are testable: each FR can be verified independently (e.g., FR-001: verify 10-15 tools are exposed; FR-008: validate normalized ticker schema contains specified fields)
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic:
  - SC-001: "query market data across 5+ exchanges" (not "via gRPC")
  - SC-005: "under 2 seconds at p95 latency" (quantifiable)
  - SC-007: "99% accuracy" on rate limits (measurable)
- Acceptance scenarios use Given/When/Then format for all user stories
- Edge cases section thoroughly covers failure scenarios, collisions, rate limiting, data format issues
- Out of Scope section clearly bounds the feature
- Dependencies (D-001 to D-008) and Assumptions (A-001 to A-010) are explicitly documented

**Feature Readiness**: ✅ PASSED
- Each of the 49 functional requirements maps to concrete acceptance criteria in user stories
- User scenarios cover critical flows:
  - P1: Exchange-agnostic queries (US1), multi-provider scalability (US2), SSE tool filtering (US6)
  - P2: Cross-exchange analysis (US3), symbol resolution (US4)
  - P3: Order execution (US5) - deferred priority
- Success Criteria align with user stories (e.g., SC-004 validates US6's goal of tool count reduction)
- No implementation leakage: terms like "gRPC", "JSON Schema", "Python" appear only in dependency/assumption contexts, not as prescriptive solutions

**Overall Assessment**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

The specification is comprehensive, well-structured, and meets all quality criteria. It clearly defines:
- **What** needs to be built (unified tools, normalization, routing, instrument registry)
- **Why** it's valuable (multi-exchange scaling, AI client usability, operational reliability)
- **How to validate** success (49 testable requirements, 10 measurable outcomes)
- **What's excluded** (streaming, smart routing, historical data, advanced exchange features)

No clarifications are needed. The feature can proceed to `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.tasks` phases.

## Recommendations for Planning Phase

1. **Prioritize Quick Fixes (FR-046 to FR-049)** as Phase 0 - these unblock multi-provider support with minimal changes
2. **Implement P1 user stories first**: US1 (unified tools), US2 (multi-provider), US6 (SSE filtering)
3. **Defer P3 story (US5)**: Order execution adds complexity; focus on read-only market data initially
4. **Consider phased rollout**: Start with 2 exchanges (Binance + OKX), validate architecture, then scale to 5+
5. **Design schema registry early**: Schema versioning (FR-010) is foundational for all unified tools
