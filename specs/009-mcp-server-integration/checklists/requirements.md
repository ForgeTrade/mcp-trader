- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review

✅ **Pass**: The specification focuses on WHAT users need (MCP integration, SSE transport, resources, prompts) without specifying HOW to implement it. While some technical terms are used (MCP, SSE, stdio), these are part of the domain language and necessary to describe the feature clearly to stakeholders.

✅ **Pass**: All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are completed with detailed content.

### Requirement Completeness Review

✅ **Pass**: No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present. The spec makes informed decisions based on industry standards:
- MCP protocol version 2024-11-05 (latest stable)
- SSE transport for remote access (standard for event streaming)
- 30-second timeout (standard web session timeout)
- 50 concurrent connections (reasonable for expected load)

✅ **Pass**: All functional requirements are testable:
- FR-001 through FR-020 can be verified through automated tests or manual inspection
- Each requirement has clear acceptance criteria in user stories
- Edge cases provide additional test scenarios

✅ **Pass**: Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic:
- SC-001: "connect...within 2 seconds" (measurable time)
- SC-002: "50 concurrent connections...500ms P95 latency" (measurable performance)
- SC-003: "timeout...within 35 seconds" (measurable time)
- SC-004: "deployment completes in under 5 minutes" (measurable time)
- SC-005 through SC-008: All have specific metrics

✅ **Pass**: All 5 user stories have detailed acceptance scenarios in Given-When-Then format.

✅ **Pass**: Edge cases section covers 5 critical scenarios with expected behavior defined.

✅ **Pass**: Scope is clearly bounded with:
- 5 prioritized user stories (P1 to P4)
- Out of Scope section with 8 items explicitly excluded
- Dependencies section identifying required components
- Assumptions section documenting decisions

### Feature Readiness Review

✅ **Pass**: All 20 functional requirements map to user stories:
- FR-001 to FR-007: Support User Story 1 (MCP Protocol via Stdio)
- FR-003, FR-008 to FR-013, FR-016 to FR-018: Support User Story 2 (SSE Transport)
- FR-008 to FR-009, FR-020: Support User Story 3 (MCP Resources)
- FR-010 to FR-011: Support User Story 4 (MCP Prompts)
- FR-014, FR-015, FR-019: Support User Story 5 (Shuttle Deployment)

✅ **Pass**: User scenarios cover all primary flows:
- P1: Core MCP integration (stdio transport)
- P2: Remote access (SSE transport)
- P3: Performance optimization (resources)
- P3: UX enhancement (prompts)
- P4: Cloud deployment (Shuttle)

✅ **Pass**: 8 success criteria map to user stories and provide measurable outcomes.

✅ **Pass**: No implementation details leak into specification. References to specific technologies (rmcp, axum, shuttle) are in Dependencies section where appropriate, not in user-facing requirements.

## Notes

All validation items passed. The specification is ready for the next phase (`/speckit.plan`).

**Key Strengths**:
1. Clear prioritization (P1-P4) with justification for each level
2. Comprehensive edge case coverage
3. Technology-agnostic success criteria with specific metrics
4. Well-defined scope with Out of Scope section

**No Issues Found**: The specification meets all quality criteria and is ready for implementation planning.
