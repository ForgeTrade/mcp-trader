# Tasks: Unified Multi-Exchange Gateway

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/011-unified-exchange-tools/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (‚úì), spec.md (‚úì)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Gateway: `mcp-gateway/mcp_gateway/`
- Binance Provider: `providers/binance-rs/src/`
- Proto: `pkg/proto/`
- Tests: `mcp-gateway/tests/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Quick Fixes (Phase 0)**: No dependencies - CRITICAL, start immediately
- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Quick Fixes + Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational completion - Core MVP
- **User Story 6 (Phase 4)**: Depends on User Story 1 - Requires unified tools to filter
- **User Story 2 (Phase 5)**: Depends on User Story 1 - Builds on routing infrastructure
- **User Story 3 (Phase 6)**: Depends on User Story 1, 2 - Requires multi-provider support
- **User Story 4 (Phase 7)**: Depends on User Story 1, 2 - Requires provider abstraction
- **Rate Limiting (Phase 8)**: Depends on User Story 1, 2, 3 - Production hardening
- **User Story 5 (Phase 9)**: Depends on Phase 8 - P3, can be deferred
- **Additional Tools (Phase 10)**: Depends on User Story 1 - Extends coverage
- **Advanced Features (Phase 11)**: Depends on Phase 10 - Optional enhancements
- **Polish (Phase 12)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 6 (P1)**: Can start after US1 - Requires unified tools to exist
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after US1 - Extends to multiple providers
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after US1, US2 - Requires multi-provider routing
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after US1, US2 - Requires provider abstraction
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after Phase 8 - Optional, low priority

### Within Each User Story

- Schema definitions before normalization implementation
- Router implementation before tool registration
- Core functionality before error handling
- Implementation before tests (tests verify implementation)

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Quick Fixes tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- Schema definitions within a phase can run in parallel
- Tests for a user story can run in parallel
- Once US1 complete, US6 can start while US2 is being implemented
- US3 and US4 can be implemented in parallel after US1+US2 complete

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch schema definitions in parallel:
Task: "Define unified ticker schema in mcp-gateway/mcp_gateway/schemas/unified/market_ticker.json"
Task: "Define unified orderbook L1 schema in mcp-gateway/mcp_gateway/schemas/unified/market_orderbook_l1.json"

# Then implement routing and normalization sequentially (depends on schemas):
Task: "Create UnifiedToolRouter class"
Task: "Implement ticker normalization for Binance"

# Then launch tests in parallel:
Task: "Create integration test for unified ticker"
Task: "Create integration test for unified routing"
```

1. Complete Phase 0: Quick Fixes (2-3 days)
2. Complete Phase 1: Setup (1 day)
3. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (2 days)
4. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (3-4 days)
5. Complete Phase 4: User Story 6 (1-2 days)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test US1 + US6 independently
7. Deploy/demo if ready

**MVP Deliverable**: AI clients can query market data through unified tools with tool filtering

### Incremental Delivery

1. MVP (Quick Fixes + US1 + US6) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
2. Add User Story 2 (multi-provider) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo

2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 6 (after US1 schemas ready)
   - Developer C: Start User Story 2 setup (schemas, provider configs)
3. After US1+US6 complete:
   - Developer A: User Story 2 (multi-provider)
   - Developer B: User Story 3 (multi-venue)
   - Developer C: User Story 4 (instrument registry)
4. After US2+US3+US4 complete:
   - Team: Phase 8 (rate limiting + observability) together
5. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Quick Fixes (Phase 0) are CRITICAL - unblock multi-provider support
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Commit after each task or logical group
- MVP = Quick Fixes + US1 + US6 (enables unified tools with filtering)
- US5 (order placement) is P3 and can be deferred for market data focus
- Additional tools (Phase 10) can be implemented incrementally based on demand
