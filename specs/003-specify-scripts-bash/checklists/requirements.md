# Specification Quality Checklist: Advanced Order Book Analytics & Streamable HTTP Transport

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-19 (Updated: 2025-10-19 - removed Shuttle.dev, kept Streamable HTTP)
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

âœ… **PASSED** - All checklist items validated successfully (Shuttle.dev removed, Streamable HTTP retained)

### Content Quality Review
- Specification focuses on user value (traders, analysts using AI; ChatGPT users)
- No Rust/WebSocket/RocksDB/Axum implementation leaked into user stories
- Language is accessible to business stakeholders ("buying pressure", "ChatGPT integration", not "Arc<HashMap<SessionId>>")
- All mandatory sections present and complete (5 user stories, 25 FRs, 17 success criteria)

### Requirement Completeness Review
- No clarification markers - all requirements concrete and specific
- Each FR tied to measurable success criteria (SC-001 through SC-017)
- Success criteria technology-agnostic:
  - "AI agents identify flow changes within 5 seconds" (not "Rust async task completes <5s")
  - "ChatGPT successfully connects" (not "Axum router configuration")
  - "Session management <50ms" (not "HashMap lookup optimization")
- Acceptance scenarios testable via natural language queries and integration testing
- 9 edge cases identified (6 analytics + 3 transport) with clear handling strategies
- Scope explicitly bounded (in/out of scope sections comprehensive - 16 in-scope items, 18 out-of-scope)
- 12 dependencies documented, 14 assumptions listed

### Feature Readiness Review
- 25 functional requirements each map to user stories and success criteria
- 5 user stories (P1-P5) independently testable as stated
  - P1-P4: Analytics features (order flow, volume profile, anomalies, liquidity)
  - P5: ChatGPT MCP integration via Streamable HTTP
- Measurable outcomes cover performance (SC-002: <500ms), accuracy (SC-003: >95%), integration (SC-010, SC-016), and UX (SC-011)
- Implementation details properly relegated to Dependencies section (RocksDB, statrs, Axum, etc.)

## Notes

Specification is **production-ready** and approved for planning phase. Proceed with `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan.

**Strengths**:
- Comprehensive coverage of advanced analytics integration from proven mcp-binance-rs codebase
- NEW: Streamable HTTP transport enables ChatGPT integration (platform-agnostic deployment)
- Clear prioritization (P1-P5) enables incremental delivery
  - Core analytics (P1-P4) can be implemented first
  - Transport feature (P5) can be added independently
- Edge cases anticipate real-world scenarios (WebSocket disconnections, session expiration, concurrent requests)
- Success criteria balance performance, accuracy, integration, and user experience
- Dual-mode operation (gRPC + Streamable HTTP) maintains backward compatibility with Python gateway
- Platform-agnostic design - no vendor lock-in to specific cloud providers

**No issues identified** - specification meets all quality standards.

**Changes from previous version**:
- Removed Shuttle.dev-specific deployment configuration (FR-022 removed, Shuttle.toml removed from scope)
- Kept Streamable HTTP transport as universal feature compatible with any deployment platform
- Reduced from 6 to 5 user stories (merged cloud deployment into transport story)
- Reduced from 26 to 25 functional requirements
- Reduced from 18 to 17 success criteria (removed Shuttle-specific SC-013)
- Removed ShuttleConfiguration entity
- Updated assumptions to be deployment-platform agnostic
