# Tasks: Feature 013 - Complete Unified Multi-Exchange API

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/013-complete-unified-api/`
**Prerequisites**: IMPLEMENTATION.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories)
**Status**: COMPLETED (2025-10-20)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Python project: `mcp-gateway/mcp_gateway/` for source code
- Tests: `mcp-gateway/tests/` for test files
- Feature 012 infrastructure already exists and is working

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Extend existing Feature 012 infrastructure with 16 new tool mappings

**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED (2025-10-20)

- [x] T001 Extend UnifiedToolRouter with 16 new tool mappings in mcp-gateway/mcp_gateway/adapters/unified_router.py
- [x] T002 [P] Add 8 new schema normalizer method stubs in mcp-gateway/mcp_gateway/adapters/schema_adapter.py
- [x] T003 [P] Update SSE server list_tools() handler to prepare for 16 new Tool definitions in mcp-gateway/mcp_gateway/sse_server.py

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core schema normalization infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be fully tested

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story implementation can be completed until normalization framework is working

**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED (2025-10-20)

- [x] T006 [P] Implement error handling for FR-022 (auth errors), FR-023 (unsupported tools), FR-024 (rate limits) in mcp-gateway/mcp_gateway/sse_server.py

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Analyst Accesses Advanced Market Analytics (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Enable market analysts to detect anomalies, assess orderbook health, and generate volume profiles using unified analytics tools

**Independent Test**: Analyst can call `analytics.detect_market_anomalies(venue="binance", instrument="BTCUSDT", window_seconds=60)` and receive normalized anomaly detection results with quote stuffing alerts

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - extends existing Feature 012 infrastructure
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1/US2

### Within Each User Story

- Tool definitions can all be written in parallel (marked [P])
- Normalizer implementations can all be written in parallel (marked [P])
- Tool definitions should be written first to establish contract
- Normalizers must be complete before story is testable

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks (T001-T003) can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks (T004-T006) can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All Tool definitions within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- All normalizer implementations within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Trading Tools)

```bash
# Launch all Tool definitions for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Add Tool definition for trade.place_order in mcp-gateway/mcp_gateway/sse_server.py"
Task: "Add Tool definition for trade.cancel_order in mcp-gateway/mcp_gateway/sse_server.py"
Task: "Add Tool definition for trade.get_order in mcp-gateway/mcp_gateway/sse_server.py"
Task: "Add Tool definition for trade.get_open_orders in mcp-gateway/mcp_gateway/sse_server.py"
Task: "Add Tool definition for trade.get_all_orders in mcp-gateway/mcp_gateway/sse_server.py"
Task: "Add Tool definition for trade.get_account in mcp-gateway/mcp_gateway/sse_server.py"
Task: "Add Tool definition for trade.get_my_trades in mcp-gateway/mcp_gateway/sse_server.py"

# Launch all normalizer implementations for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Implement _normalize_binance_order() normalizer in mcp-gateway/mcp_gateway/adapters/schema_adapter.py"
Task: "Implement _normalize_binance_account() normalizer in mcp-gateway/mcp_gateway/adapters/schema_adapter.py"
Task: "Implement _normalize_binance_trade() normalizer in mcp-gateway/mcp_gateway/adapters/schema_adapter.py"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (extend router, add normalizer stubs)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (normalization framework, error handling) - CRITICAL
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (7 trading tools + 3 normalizers)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently - place order, cancel order, query status
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP: Trading tools working!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Analytics added!)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Complete unified API!)
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Trading tools)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Analytics tools)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Market metadata tools)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Actual vs Estimated Timeline

**Estimated** (from IMPLEMENTATION.md): 24 hours (3 days at 8h/day)
- Task 1 (Router): 2 hours
- Task 2 (Normalizers): 8 hours
- Task 3 (Tool Definitions): 4 hours
- Task 4 (call_tool integration): 3 hours
- Testing: 5 hours
- Deployment: 2 hours

**Actual**: ~4-6 hours (implementation completed in single session on 2025-10-20)

**Variance**: Significantly faster due to:
- Clear specification and requirements in spec.md
- Existing architecture from Feature 012 providing solid foundation
- All infrastructure (UnifiedToolRouter, SchemaAdapter, SSE server) already in place
- No architectural surprises or blockers encountered

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability (US1, US2, US3)
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Tool definitions establish the contract - implement these first
- Normalizers make responses consistent - implement after tool definitions
- Feature 012 provides the foundation - this feature extends it
- All tasks completed retroactively on 2025-10-20 in a single implementation session
